# Isoform-Research-in-COVID-Infected-Tissue
Research of SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549 ACE2-expressing cells in human lung 
tissue. I am using R Bioconductor and its vast tools to perform RNA sequencing, 
and research further into how isoforms can greatly effect protein dynamics even
when gene expression doesn't appear to change at the mRNA level. Novel isoforms
can tell us more about antiviral targets, host cell protein dysfunction, and 
reveal more about how COVID manipulates the cell while avoiding the immune 
system.
